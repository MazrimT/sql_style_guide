# sql_style_guide

After many years working with SQL I've never seen a good style guide of how to write good looking SQL that people enjoy maintaining.
This is my atempt at plotting down as much as possible.

This is a generic style that should work for most SQL-type databases.
For some, like SQL Server where you can do "alias = source" instead of "source as alias" some things and be turned around.
